        <h1>Croissant</h1>

        <p>Croissants may be the flaky French darlings of breakfast, but their buttery drama actually begins in Austria,
            where they
            started life as humble kipferls—possibly introduced to France by Marie Antoinette herself (because of course
            she’d bring
            snacks). Shaped like a crescent to celebrate victory over the Ottomans, packed with at least 25% butter (no
            margarine
            allowed, merci), and puffed up by steamy science magic, these golden pastries are as much art as breakfast.
            Whether
            you're team almond, chocolate-stuffed, or cronut-curious, just remember: in France, the straight ones are
            the
            buttery
            royalty, and if you’re really living your best life, you’re tearing yours in half and dunking it in coffee
            like
            a très
            chic rebel.</p>
